## 1. Describe the path an HTTP Request takes from a browser to your GitHub Pages site.
The browser and server communicate using HTTP. Therefore, the browser sends a request via the internet to the web server that hosts the site. Then, the web server locates the HTML file (in this case, index.html) and sends it back to your browser. And finally the browser will be able to display the page!

## 2. We discussed Docker Containers in class. Explain how a Docker Container differs from the environment provided by GitHub Pages.
A Docker container in a sense is a container that takes an application and puts everything an application needs in order to run, such as, libraries, system tools, dependencies, etc. Github pages is different than a Docker container because it hosts only files such as HTML, CSS, and JS. But does not provide control over the actual operating system or runtime environment. Github pages more so serves the files in the repository to users through http. While Docker is able to provide full control over the environment.

## 3. AI Attribution: If you used GenAI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to help write code, you must include the prompt you used and explain one logic error the AI made that you had to fix manually.
